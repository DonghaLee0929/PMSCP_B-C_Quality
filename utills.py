    """
    Performs an assignment procedure using an EDD (Earliest Due Date) approach in conjunction with a Gurobi solver.
    The function iteratively attempts to obtain a feasible assignment that satisfies both the assignment and EDD conditions.
    If the assignment method fails to produce a result within the allotted assignment time (assign_max_time),
    a TimeoutError is raised. Additionally, if the total elapsed time exceeds max_time or if Lambda reaches 2 
    (indicating that the instance might be infeasible), the function terminates early.
    
    When an infeasible assignment is detected (i.e., alloc.status equals GRB.INFEASIBLE), Lambda is increased by delta.
    The function also tracks the number of assignments and records the first assignment time via the recoder object.
    After obtaining an optimal assignment, it verifies the EDD feasibility. If the EDD check fails, the ban list is 
    updated and the process continues until both assignment and EDD conditions are met.
    
    Parameters:
        alloc (assignment): The assignment object that integrates the EDD mechanism.
        optimal_lb (int): The optimal lower bound for the assignment result.
        Gamma (float): A parameter used in the Gurobi assignment setup.
        Lambda (float): A parameter that is adjusted (increased by delta) if the assignment is infeasible.
        delta (float): The incremental value added to Lambda upon detecting an infeasible assignment.
        recoder (datarecoder): An object for recording assignment statistics (e.g., assignment count, first assignment time).
        ban (Ban): The ban list that is used and updated during the assignment process.
        pattern (dict): A dictionary of patterns; only entries with non-None keys where both values are equal are used.
        guide (dict): A guidance dictionary used in the assignment process.
        assign_max_time (int): Maximum time allowed for each assignment attempt.
        max_time (int): Maximum overall time allowed for the entire assignment procedure.
    
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - alloc_result: The final assignment result from the Gurobi solver.
            - edd_feasible (bool): True if the EDD feasibility condition is satisfied; otherwise, False.
            - Lambda (float): The final value of Lambda after adjustments.
            - alloc.ban_list: The ban list used during the assignment process.
            - edd_iteration_num (int): The number of iterations performed to satisfy the EDD condition.
            - optimal_lb (int): The updated optimal lower bound (which does not decrease from previous assignments).

def pattern_manager(env: Env, schedule: list, temp_pattern: list, temp_pattern_information: list, pattern: Pattern, ban: Ban, guide: Guide):
    """
    Updates the pattern list, ban list, and guide based on temporary patterns and their feasibility status.

    This function processes each temporary pattern in 'temp_pattern' and updates the main 'pattern' container
    accordingly. For each temporary pattern:
      - If the pattern is marked as infeasible (tp[1] is False), it is added to the ban list.
      - Otherwise, the function counts job families for entries in the pattern (where a job is active if its value is 1).
        - If the pattern contains jobs from two or more families, it checks whether a minimum setup is possible using
          the 'check_min_setup' function.
            - If the minimum setup is not possible:
                - If exactly two families are present, it calls 'guide_manager' to update the guide.
                - Otherwise, it appends a tuple containing the pattern and the number of families to the guide.
            - If a minimum setup is possible, the pattern is added to the pattern list (with a ValueError raised if the feasibility indicator is None).
      - If the feasibility indicator is None (unknown), the pattern is added with unknown bounds.
      - For patterns that are feasible or optimal:
            - If there is no previous pattern information or this is the first occurrence of the pattern, the pattern and its lower bound (as guide) are appended.
            - If the pattern has been seen before (with previous information available), the function updates the stored pattern bounds if the current results show improvement.
    
    Parameters:
        env (Env): The environment object containing job-to-family mappings and other configuration details.
        schedule (list): A list representing the schedule (its usage is implied within the environment).
        temp_pattern (list): A list of temporary patterns, where each entry is a list or tuple with at least three elements.
        temp_pattern_information (list): A list containing additional information about each temporary pattern.
        pattern (Pattern): The primary container for patterns that is updated by this function.
        ban (Ban): A list or container that holds patterns deemed infeasible.
        guide (Guide): A list used to store guidance information, such as lower bounds for feasible patterns.
    
    Returns:
        None. This function updates the 'pattern', 'ban', and 'guide' objects in place.
    
    Raises:

    Determines and updates guide information based on two job families by constructing minimal subsets

    This function calculates a "reasonable" maximum number of families that can be assigned to a machine,
    based on the ratio of total families to machines. If this maximum is at least 2 (since cases with only one
    family per machine are not considered), the function proceeds as follows:
    
      1. Constructs a dictionary that maps each family to the list of job indices belonging to that family.
      2. Iterates over all possible combinations of families (from 2 up to the computed reasonable maximum).
      3. For each combination:
           - Builds a combined dictionary (comb_dict) for the selected families.
           - Creates a bitmask (all_jobs_tuple) representing all jobs belonging to these families.
           - Checks if a minimum setup is possible for this combination using the 'check_min_setup' function.
               * If a minimum setup is not possible:
                   - For combinations of three or more families, appends the bitmask and the family count (n)
                     to the guide.
                   - For combinations of exactly two families, calls 'find_min_subset_two_family' to update the guide.
               * If a minimum setup is possible, updates the pattern dictionary with both lower and upper bounds set to n-1.

def framework(env: Env, Gamma: float, Lambda: float, delta: float, recoder: Datarecoder, assign_max_time=180, seq_max_time=180, max_time=60*60):
    """
    Main framework that integrates assignment (via an EDD approach) and sequencing (using a CP parallel method).

    This function orchestrates the overall procedure to improve the assignment of jobs by iteratively:
      1. Setting up initial ban, guide, and pattern information.
      2. Running the assignment procedure to obtain an assignment result and verify its EDD feasibility.
      3. If the assignment is EDD feasible, it resets and invokes the sequencing procedure to obtain an improved schedule
         along with new pattern information.
      4. Evaluating the new solution based on the sum of upper bounds (ub) from the temporary patterns.
      5. Updating the best found solution if an improvement is detected.
      6. Managing and updating the guide, pattern, and ban lists via the pattern_manager.
      7. Terminating if a solution matching the lower bound is found, if the EDD fails, or if the overall maximum time is exceeded.

    Parameters:
        env (Env): The environment object containing jobs, families, machines, deadlines, durations, etc.
        Gamma (float): A parameter used in the assignment procedure.
        Lambda (float): A parameter used in the assignment procedure that is adjusted when an assignment is infeasible.
        delta (float): The incremental value added to Lambda upon detecting an infeasible assignment.
        recoder (datarecoder): An object used to record statistics such as assignment counts and execution times.
        assign_max_time (int, optional): Maximum time allowed for each assignment attempt. Defaults to 180 seconds.
        seq_max_time (int, optional): Maximum time allowed for each sequencing attempt. Defaults to 180 seconds.
        max_time (int, optional): Maximum total execution time for the entire framework. Defaults to 3600 seconds (1 hour).

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - best (int): The best objective value (lower bound of the sum of setups) found.
            - best_schedule: The best schedule (sequence) corresponding to the best objective value.
            - Lambda (float): The final value of Lambda after all adjustments.
